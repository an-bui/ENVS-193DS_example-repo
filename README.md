# Antarctic penguin analysis

## Introduction

This is the repository associated with the analysis project titled "Penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica". In this analysis, we asked:  
1) how male and female Adelie penguins differ in flipper length,  
2) how penguin bill length predicts bill width, and  
3) what set of variables best predict penguin body mass.

## Data and file overview

This repository is organized as follows:

```

## Sharing and accessing information

This repository and the associated analysis are examples of expectations for the ENVS 193DS final.

We used the `penguins` data set in the `{palmerpenguins}` package:

Horst AM, Hill AP, Gorman KB (2020). palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data. R package version 0.1.0. <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/>. doi: [10.5281/zenodo.3960218](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html).

The data were originally published in:
